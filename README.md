You're a developer—your time is valuable. You don’t want to spend hours fine-tuning machine learning models when all you need is a working solution. OneLinerML lets you train, evaluate, and deploy ML models with just one line of code.

⚡ Why Developers Love OneLinerML

✅ Minimal Code, Maximum Impact – No complex pipelines. Just pass your dataset, and OneLinerML does the rest.

✅ Prebuilt ML Workflows – Forget about data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, or feature scaling—we handle it.

✅ Instant API Deployment – Train a model and deploy it as an API with zero setup.

✅ Scikit-Learn & XGBoost Support – Integrates seamlessly with your favorite ML frameworks.


🚀 Get Started in Seconds
from OneLinerML import train
# Train a model in one line
model, report = train("data.csv", target="price", algorithm="random_forest")
print(report)

No debugging nightmares. No messy dependencies. Just results
